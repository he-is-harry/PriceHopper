PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Pineapples have a diamond-patterned skin that resembles a pinecone with crisp, green leaves shooting out the top. The distinctive flavour of the pineapple's golden yellow flesh is sweet and tangy. Once cut, pineapple makes a great addition to smoothies, or slice yours to make a pineapple upside-down cake.
